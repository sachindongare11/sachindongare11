# 👋 Hi, I’m Sachin Dongare

I’m an **Applied AI Researcher / Data Scientist** with a strong belief that **classical Machine Learning and statistical reasoning still outperform GenAI in many real-world, high-impact domains** — especially when data quality, interpretability, and robustness matter.

My work sits at the intersection of **ML theory, experimentation, and practical deployment**, with hands-on experience across NLP, LLM-based systems, and end-to-end ML pipelines.

---

## 👀 What I’m interested in

- Extracting **meaningful, decision-ready insights** from complex data  
- Applying **statistical analysis and ML theory** to real-world, messy datasets  
- Designing **experiments**, evaluating models rigorously, and understanding *why* systems work or fail  
- Bridging the gap between **research ideas and usable AI systems**

---

## 🌱 What I’m currently exploring

- Moving beyond GenAI hype to **fine-tune, adapt, and evaluate existing models**  
- Practical trade-offs between **classical ML, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches**  
- Model evaluation, error analysis, and robustness in real deployment settings  
- Responsible use of LLMs: grounding, hallucination mitigation, and controlled generation  

---

## 💞️ Open to collaborating on

I’m particularly interested in **applied, impact-driven projects**, including:

- 🌍 Sustainability & climate change  
- 🌦️ Weather, environmental, and real-time data systems  
- 🌎 Natural disaster analysis (earthquakes, floods, extreme events)  
- 🏥 Healthcare and public-interest ML applications  

If the problem is meaningful and data-driven, I’m interested.

## 🛠️ Technical focus (at a glance)

- **Machine Learning & Statistics:** regression, classification, time series, experimental design  
- **NLP & LLMs:** embeddings, RAG, evaluation, fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)  
- **Research & MLOps:** MLflow, reproducibility, model evaluation, drift monitoring  
- **Cloud & Data:** Azure ML, Databricks, GCP, SQL, Spark, Pandas  
- **Languages:** Python (primary), SQL, C#
